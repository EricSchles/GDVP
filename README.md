# Generic Data Validator Platform (GDVP)

The generic data validator platform is a skeleton with the following pieces:

* ETL
  * Extra data from various filetypes
  * transform the data:
      * syntactically
      * semantically
  * process data at scale
* data validation
 
The goal of the generic data validator platform is for engineers to be able to white label the platform, 
add the functionality they need for a specific project, and then deploy with ease.  The generic piece of
this platform will be a set of premade classes and archtectural pieces in order to scale a code base as fast
as possible.
